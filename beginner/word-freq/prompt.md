I'll provide you with a beginner-friendly Golang problem that tests fundamental programming concepts without being overwhelming.

# Problem: Word Frequency Counter

**Task**: Write a program in Go that reads text from standard input and counts the frequency of each word, then prints the words and their counts in descending order of frequency.

**Requirements**:

1. Convert all text to lowercase before processing
2. Remove punctuation (periods, commas, etc.)
3. Only count actual words (no empty strings)
4. Display results sorted by frequency (highest first)
5. In case of a tie, sort alphabetically

**Example Input**:

```
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barks, but the fox keeps running.
```

**Example Output**:

```
the: 3
fox: 2
dog: 2
brown: 1
but: 1
jumps: 1
keeps: 1
lazy: 1
over: 1
quick: 1
running: 1
```

This problem tests your ability to:

- Process strings in Go
- Use appropriate data structures (maps)
- Implement basic sorting
- Handle input/output
- Apply simple algorithms
